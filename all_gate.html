<h1 class="text-warning" >About GATE</h1>
The Graduate Aptitude Test in Engineering (GATE) is an examination that primarily tests the comprehensive understanding of various undergraduate
 subjects in engineering and science for admission into the Masters Program of institutes as well as jobs at Public Sector Companies. 
 GATE is conducted jointly by the Indian Institute of Science and seven Indian Institutes of Technologies at Roorkee, Delhi, Guwahati,
 Kanpur, Kharagpur, Chennai (Madras) and Mumbai (Bombay) on behalf of the National Coordination Board – GATE, Department of Higher Education, 
 Ministry of Human Resources Development (MHRD), Government of India.

The GATE score of a candidate reflects the relative performance level of a candidate. The score is used for admissions to various post-graduate 
education programs (e.g. Master of Engineering, Master of Technology, Master of Architecture, Doctor of Philosophy) in Indian higher education
 institutes, with financial assistance provided by MHRD and other government agencies. Recently, GATE scores are also being used by several Indian 
 public sector undertakings for recruiting graduate engineers in entry-level positions. It is one of the most competitive examinations in India.
 GATE is also recognized by various institutes outside India, such as Nanyang Technological University in Singapore.

<h2 class="text-warning">Duration and examination type</h2>
The examination is of 3 hours duration, and contains a total of 65 questions worth a maximum of 100 marks. The examination for all the papers is 
carried out in an online Computer Based Test (CBT) mode where the candidates are shown the questions in a random sequence on a computer screen.
 The questions consist of some Multiple Choice Questions or MCQs (four answer options out of which only ONE is correct, which has to be chosen). 
 Remaining questions may be of Multiple Select Questions or MSQs (four answer options out of which ONE or MORE than ONE is/are correct, hence 
 correct options need to be chosen) and/or Numerical Answer Type questions or NATs (answer is a real number, to be entered via an on-screen
 keypad and computer mouse).

<div class="container text-white w3-serif w3-center w3-large" id="SYLLABUS">
<h1 class="w3-padding-48">GATE Syllabus for CS</h1>
 Computer Science and Information Technology is a field that focuses on the basic elements of computer programming and 
networking. The syllabus is based on the topics of graduation level which is further divided into 10 major sections. Out of these 10 sections, 
section 1 is entirely based on the topics of Engineering Mathematics. 

In GATE CS paper, 72% of the syllabus is from Core Engineering Syllabus or subject syllabus, 13% of Engineering Mathematics, and 15% of General 
Aptitude. Check GATE  CS Exam Pattern
One must note that all GATE  papers will have General Aptitude as a compulsory section. The paper will consist of 65 questions worth 100 marks. 
Candidates are also eligible to appear for a maximum of 2 papers.

<p> GATE cut off is the minimum marks that you need to score to qualify the exam. Since the exam will be conducted in multiple sessions with 
different difficulty levels, the normalization method will be used for GATE Score Calculation.

The participating institutes will decide their own cut off to select the candidates for a course. Other than M.Tech admissions, students who 
score marks higher than GATE cutoff are often recruited into highly paid jobs offered by many PSUs. GATE Scorecard will be issued to only those 
candidates who score equal to or more than the qualifying cut off of GATE 2021.</p>

<h4 class="text-warning w3-serif">1. Understand the GATE syllabus and pattern –</h4>
<h5 class="w3-serif">The first step in GATE preparation is understanding the GATE syllabus and pattern. This is necessary as the syllabus may differ a little each year
 and there might be minute changes in the pattern as well. Moreover, a thorough study plan cannot be created until the exam syllabus and pattern 
 are known.</h5>
 
<h4 class="text-warning font-weight-bold w3-serif">2. Find the books required according to the syllabus –</h4>
<h5 class="w3-serif">There are many recommended books available for all subjects of the GATE exam. Generally, two or three books are enough for a particular subject
 where one book can be used in the start and other books can be referred if any doubts arise.</h5>
 
<h4 class="text-warning font-weight-bold w3-serif">3. Create a study plan for GATE preparation-</h4>
<h5 class="w3-serif">It is necessary to have a study plan for GATE preparation as it inculcates discipline and time management skills. It is best to create 
a unique study plan tailored to the strengths and weaknesses of the individual with the appropriate revision and evaluation slots.</h5>


<h4 class="text-warning font-weight-bold w3-serif">4. Focus on Aptitude and Mathematics as well –</h4>
<h5 class="w3-serif">It is very important to focus on Aptitude and Mathematics as they are quite scoring subjects and constitute around 30 marks in the GATE exam. 
These subjects can be studied from the standard recommended books and practiced with the help of the previous year GATE papers.</h5>

<h4 class="text-warning font-weight-bold w3-serif">5. Prepare notes on the relevant topics –</h4>
<h5 class="w3-serif">Preparing notes with the important information and formulae is vital as these notes can be referred later during revision. This cuts down on 
the revision time as the notes contain important information from all subjects in a single place. Notes for GATE CS 
are available at GeeksforGeeks.</h5>


<h4 class="text-warning font-weight-bold w3-serif">6. Strengthen your conceptual knowledge –</h4>
<h5 class="w3-serif">It is important to have conceptual clarity as GATE is an exam that tests the candidates’ concepts and has very little questions that have 
direct application of formulae. Also, understanding of the subject concepts can lead to the correct response in GATE if there are
 any doubts as to the answer.</h5>
 
 
<h4 class="text-warning font-weight-bold w3-serif">7. Familiarize yourself with the virtual calculator –</h4>
<h5 class="w3-serif">The virtual calculator can be a little complicated and so it is important to familiarize yourself with it before the GATE exam. This 
can result in an increase in calculation speed which is very advantageous in a competitive exam like GATE.</h5>


<h4 class="text-warning font-weight-bold w3-serif">8. Evaluate your understanding of a topic after studying it –
<h5 class="w3-serif">It is very important to evaluate your understanding of a topic after studying it. This will reveal the weak points in your 
preparation that can then be eliminated. Moreover, self-evaluation also helps in retaining the knowledge that you have learnt.</h5>

<h4 class="text-warning font-weight-bold w3-serif">9.Revise the topics at suitable intervals –</h4>
<h5 class="w3-serif">After understanding a topic thoroughly, it is important to revise it at suitable intervals otherwise there is a chance of forgetting it.
 Revision can be done using the short notes or flash cards made during studying.</h5>
 
<h4 class="w3-serif text-warning font-weight-bold">10. Analyze previous GATE papers and attempt multiple mock tests –</h4>
<h5 class="w3-serif">Analyzing and attempting previous GATE papers and GATE mock tests is an excellent way of understanding the GATE structure in a controlled 
environment. This also helps in improving time management skills and reduces silly mistakes in the actual GATE exam.</h5>
